    "text": "Who Can Benefit from This Book\nI wrote this textbook for two groups of readers. The first group is the participants of the workshop Getting Started with R for Economists: A Hands-On Workshop, which was organized for the 52nd Meeting of the Sri Lanka Forum of University Economists. This book serves as a companion to that workshop. Since the workshop lasts only one hour, the goal is to introduce participants to the tidyverse workflow and give them a strong foundation so they can continue learning on their own.\nThe second group is any economist who is new to programming and wants to start analyzing data using R. This book is a good starting point for your journey. However, to master each topic fully, I recommend reading more advanced textbooks on R, covering the different areas discussed here.",

In my example, since I saved my project as “Test,” the R project file is called “Test.Rproj.” Inside this folder, you can create subfolders, like one for figures called figures, another for raw data files called data, and another for your R script files called scripts.\nLet’s say you’re done working on the project for the day. Now, close the project and quit RStudio.\nThe next day, when you come back to the project, locate the folder (in my case, it’s on the Desktop), open it, and double-click the .Rproj file. This will reopen the project, and you’ll pick up right where you left off. You’ll have access to all the files you’ve saved inside the RStudio Project.\nThe only things you can’t retrieve are the commands you typed directly into the console and any unsaved outputs, like summary statistics or figures that were not saved.\nBut script files at least allow you to save time by preventing you from retyping commands or complex code you’ve already written in previous sessions. They’re better than typing directly into the console.",

For those already familiar with R Markdown, you’ll find the transition to Quarto very easy, as the syntax is very similar.\n\n4.2.1 Installing Quarto\nA stable release of Quarto is included with RStudio version 2022.07.1 and later. Upgrading to future versions of RStudio will also upgrade the bundled version of Quarto.\n\n\n4.2.2 Why Quarto ?\n\nQuarto supports multiple programming languages (R, Python, Julia, and more) within the same document, allowing for a more versatile workflow.\nQuarto provides a wider range of output formats, including HTML, PDF, Word, and slides, all from a single document. This flexibility makes it easier to publish content in various formats without needing separate files.\nQuarto is designed with modern development practices in mind, making it easier to integrate with version control systems like Git.\nQuarto offers advanced features for customization, including the ability to create custom formats and templates, which can help in producing highly tailored outputs.\nQuarto is actively developed with a focus on modern data science practices, which means it benefits from ongoing improvements and a growing community.",

    "text": "4.4 Anatomy of a Quarto document\nNow that you know how to render a Quarto document, let’s get familiar with the anatomy of a Quarto document. The file contains three types of content: a YAML header, code chunks, and markdown text.\nIn addition to that, we can view the same .qmd document in two modes of the RStudio editor: visual (on the left) and source (on the right). Open the source window so that you can easily identify the syntax..\n\n4.4.1 YAML header\n\nIn Quarto, YAML (which stands for YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is used for setting up metadata and configurations for your document.\nIt is placed at the top of the Quarto file within three dashes (—), and it allows you to specify document options such as the title, author, output format (HTML, PDF, Word), date, and more.\nIn YAML, the basic format is key: value, where you assign a value to a key.\n\n---\ntitle: \"Getting Started with Quarto\"\nsubtitle: \"Report 1\"\nauthor: \"Priyanga Talagala\"\ndate: \"2025-01-31\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n\n4.4.2 Code Chunks\n\nIn Quarto, code chunks are sections of the document where you can write and run code. You can think of this part as a mini console window within the Quarto document.\nA code chunk in Quarto is enclosed between three backticks (```) to separate it from the rest of the text.\nThe code inside these chunks is executed when you render the document, and the output (such as tables, plots, or results) is displayed directly in the final document.\nThese chunks can contain code written in different programming languages, such as R, Python, or Julia. In the following example, {r} indicates that we are going to run R code inside this code chunk.\nIf you want to run Python code, you just need to replace {r} with {python} in the code chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Chunks. LHS : Source file, RHS: Resulted output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Markdown text\n\nMarkdown text includes formatted text, such as section headers, paragraphs, embedded images, and more. Quarto uses Markdown syntax for writing text, which is clear when you switch to the Source tab.\nTo define section headings, you use the # symbol. The number of # symbols determines the level of the heading: one # for an H1 heading, two ## for an H2 heading, three ### for an H3 heading, and so on.\nIn R Markdown syntax, you can format text as follows:\n\nTo make text bold, use **bold**.\nTo make text italic, use *italic*.\n\n\nThis is **bold** text and this is *italic* text.\nThis is bold text and this is italic text.",

Next, we tidy up the data to make it clean and usable. Then, as data scientists, our main task is to understand the data using three key tools: transformation, visualization, and modeling. Finally, we communicate our results to the right people to support decision-making.\nThe tidyverse package is a collection of R packages that work together to make data analysis easier.

Sometimes, you may need to add new variables using data from other variables. Other times, you may need to filter specific rows or columns from the original dataset. You might also need to summarize the data or rename the columns properly.\nThis is where the data transformation step comes in.\nThe dplyr package provides powerful tools to transform your data into the desired format. Some of the most commonly used functions in dplyr include:\n\nfilter() – Select specific rows based on conditions\nselect() – Choose specific columns\nmutate() – Create or modify columns\nsummarise() – Calculate summary statistics\narrange() – Sort rows by a column\ngroup_by() – Group data for grouped operations\nrename() – Change column names\n\nBy performing these tasks, you change the structure of the original dataset as demontrated below, which is why it’s called the data transformation step.\n\n\n\n\n\nData transformation, The original image, available here https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/lise.vaudor/dplyr/, has been updated with new additions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData transformation, The original image, available here https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/lise.vaudor/dplyr/, has been updated with new additions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData transformation, The original image, available here https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/lise.vaudor/dplyr/, has been updated with new additions.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Example\nLet’s consider the following dataset whihc contains synthetic airline data.\nDownload the dataset: airline_data.csv Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/airline-dataset/data\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"data\", \"airline_data.csv\"))\n\nRows: 98619 Columns: 15\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (14): Passenger ID, First Name, Last Name, Gender, Nationality, Airport ...\ndbl  (1): Age\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ndim(data)\n\n[1] 98619    15\n\n\n\ncolnames(data)\n\n [1] \"Passenger ID\"         \"First Name\"           \"Last Name\"           \n [4] \"Gender\"               \"Age\"                  \"Nationality\"         \n [7] \"Airport Name\"         \"Airport Country Code\" \"Country Name\"        \n[10] \"Airport Continent\"    \"Continents\"           \"Departure Date\"      \n[13] \"Arrival Airport\"      \"Pilot Name\"           \"Flight Status\"       \n\n\nDataset Glossary (Column-wise)\nPassenger ID - Unique identifier for each passenger\nFirst Name - First name of the passenger\nLast Name - Last name of the passenger\nGender - Gender of the passenger\nAge - Age of the passenger\nNationality - Nationality of the passenger\nAirport Name - Name of the airport where the passenger boarded\nAirport Country Code - Country code of the airport’s location\nCountry Name - Name of the country the airport is located in\nAirport Continent - Continent where the airport is situated\nContinents - Continents involved in the flight route\nDeparture Date - Date when the flight departed\nArrival Airport - Destination airport of the flight\nPilot Name - Name of the pilot operating the flight\nFlight Status - Current status of the flight (e.g., on-time, delayed, canceled)\nThis synthetic dataset covers global airline operations.
